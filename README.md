# hello-world
Just another repository
On a mission to improve the lives of those around me.

Multimedia Major, I love a challenge and learning something new.
I have experience with Swift, Java, Python, PHP (and some related frameworks), SQL, 
MongoDB, JavaScript (and some related frameworks), JSON, HTML and CSS.
I'm a Website Designer and Developer but recently fell in love with Swift and I determined to go somewhere with that.
